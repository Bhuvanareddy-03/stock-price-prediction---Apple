This Streamlit app forecasts Apple stock prices using ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM models. 
Users can upload a CSV file with stock data, choose a model from the sidebar dropdown, and select the number of forecast days using a slider. 
The app displays the historical closing price, visualizes the selected model’s predictions, and generates a future forecast.
A button at the top highlights the best-performing model based on RMSE. 
The app requires columns like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume in the uploaded file.
To run the app, install the required packages listed in requirements.txt and launch it with streamlit run app.py.
